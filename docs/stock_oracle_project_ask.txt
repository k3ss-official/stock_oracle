Develop a comprehensive strategic and tactical project document for an AI-driven investment analysis tool focusing on "Under The Radar" companies in the AI infrastructure supply chain. The system should identify and track companies meeting these criteria:

1. Provide essential products/services for AI industry growth
2. Have verifiable contracts, RFIs, or RFPs with major AI companies or their suppliers
3. Show growth curves roughly matching those of major AI companies and related utilities

Key Project Components:

1. Data Collection and Analysis System
2. Growth Curve Correlation Algorithm
3. Contract and Deal Verification Module
4. Social Media and Tech Blog Mining Tool
5. Predictive Modeling for Investment Opportunities
6. User Interface for Subscription-Based Access

Revenue Model Expansion:

1. Primary Model: Subscription-based access (similar to LexisNexis)

2. Additional Revenue Streams to Explore:
   - Data licensing to financial institutions and market research firms
   - Custom report generation for specific sectors or companies
   - API access for integration with other financial tools
   - Consulting services based on the tool's insights
   - Hosted workshops or webinars on AI infrastructure investment trends
   - Partnerships with investment firms for exclusive insights
   - Premium features for high-level subscribers (e.g., real-time alerts, direct analyst support)

3. AI-Driven Revenue Model Innovation:
   Implement an AI system to continuously analyze the collected data and user behavior to suggest and test new revenue models. This system should:
   - Identify patterns in data usage that could lead to new product offerings
   - Analyze market trends to propose innovative pricing structures
   - Suggest potential cross-industry applications of the data
   - Recommend personalized product bundles based on user behavior

Project Development:

- Use Replit as the primary development platform for the MVP
- Incorporate cutting-edge T2A tools and AI agents for autonomous data collection and analysis
- Plan for scalability, with eventual deployment on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS Elastic)

The project document should detail:

1. Technical architecture and development roadmap
2. AI model selection and integration strategy
3. Data sourcing and verification methodologies
4. User experience design for various customer segments
5. Scalability and performance optimization plans
6. Legal and ethical compliance measures
7. Marketing and customer acquisition strategies
8. Continuous improvement and innovation processes

Emphasize how this tool not only provides unique investment insights but also serves as a valuable data resource for understanding AI industry growth patterns and supply chain dynamics. The AI-driven approach to revenue model innovation should position the project to adapt quickly to market needs and maximize the value of the accumulated data.

Please provide a detailed strategic plan and project roadmap that encompasses these elements, with a focus on creating a versatile, AI-powered platform that goes beyond traditional investment tools to become a comprehensive resource for AI industry intelligence.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
