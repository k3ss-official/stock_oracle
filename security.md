## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **No Credentials in Code**: Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or other credentials to the repository.
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
4. **Code Review**: All code changes should undergo security-focused code review.
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses before processing.

### For Users

1. **API Security**: When using the Stock Oracle API, always use secure authentication methods.
2. **Data Privacy**: Be mindful of the data you share with the system.
3. **Regular Updates**: Always use the latest version of the software to benefit from security patches.

## Security Features

The Stock Oracle project implements the following security measures:
